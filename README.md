# TriviaQuestions-Java-APICalling

Trivia mobile application implements one activity and three fragments using OkHttp library for making HTTP connections and API calls. The first fragment is the Welcome Fragment, which allows the user to start a new trivia game by retrieving trivia questions using the /api/trivia API and sending the list of questions to the Main Activity. The second fragment is the Trivia Fragment, which displays the question details, answers, and images, allows the user to answer each question, and communicates with the /api/trivia/checkAnswer API to check the provided answer. The third fragment is the Stats Fragment, which displays the statistics summary of questions that were answered correctly from the first attempt and communicates with the Main Activity to replace the current fragment with the Welcome fragment when the "Start New game" button is clicked. All network calls are done in a background thread, and all UI changes are being performed on the main thread.
